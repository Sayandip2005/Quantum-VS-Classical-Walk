## üß† Concept Overview
This project explores and compares the behavior of a Classical Random Walk and a Quantum Walk on a one-dimensional line.

In a Classical Random Walk, a particle moves either left or right at each step, determined by random probability (like flipping a fair coin). Over many steps, this randomness produces a binomial, bell-shaped distribution centered around the origin. The spread of this distribution grows proportionally to the square root of the number of steps, representing a diffusive process.

In contrast, a Quantum Walk utilizes the principles of quantum superposition and interference. The particle simultaneously exists in both left and right states, with its evolution governed by unitary operations such as the Hadamard and shift gates. This results in constructive and destructive interference, forming an asymmetric, double-peaked distribution that spreads much faster ‚Äî linearly with the number of steps.

The difference in how the two walks spread reveals the computational advantage of quantum mechanics. While classical walks spread slowly and diffusively, quantum walks propagate ballistically, allowing information to travel faster. This property forms the foundation for several quantum algorithms, including Grover‚Äôs search and quantum transport models.

Quantum walks form the foundation of several **quantum algorithms** such as Grover‚Äôs search and element distinctness.  
This project provides an intuitive understanding of how quantum mechanics alters computation and probability dynamics.
